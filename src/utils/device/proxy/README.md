# Device proxy

The host side of the CPU proxy. Where a transport has no device-callable submission path, GPU
kernels write fixed-layout commands (`proxy_protocol.h`) into per-channel rings, and host threads
turn each command into an ordinary backend transfer through a `nixl::proxyTransport`. The proxy
ignores `nixl::gpu::flags::defer`; a command carries no flags until a consumer exists.

## Transport contract

`nixl::proxyTransport` (`proxy_transport.h`) is the interface a backend implements to sit behind
the proxy. It is internal to `libnixl_device_proxy` and the plugins: not installed, not an ABI.

### Ownership

- `proxyRuntime::create()` takes ownership of the transport. The runtime calls `shutdown()` and
  destroys the transport after its workers have joined.
- Anything the transport references (engine workers, endpoints) must outlive the runtime. The
  owning engine shuts the runtime down first in its destructor.

### Threading

- `init()` and `shutdown()` run with no worker thread alive.
- `submit()`, `progress()` and `quiesce()` for any ring of channel c, and `checkCompletion()` for
  requests submitted on those rings, are made from a single thread at a time. Different channels
  may be served concurrently by different threads.
- `resolveDirectPtrs()` runs on an application thread, concurrently with the calls above, and must
  not touch per-ring state.
- `submit()`, `checkCompletion()` and `progress()` are the data path: no locks and no atomic
  read-modify-write shared across channels.

### Requests

- At most `config.ring_depth` requests are outstanding per (channel, peer).
- `submit()` returns `NIXL_IN_PROG` with a non-empty request, or a terminal status with an empty
  request (`NIXL_SUCCESS`: complete now; error: never posted). It must not return a transient
  error: a transport that cannot post now returns `NIXL_IN_PROG` and posts from `progress()`.
- The runtime polls a ring's requests in submission order and never passes a request again after
  `checkCompletion()` has returned a terminal status for it.
- A terminal status releases the handle. It does not promise that the transport has stopped
  accessing the operation's memory (UCX under err-mode none cannot abort a put). Only `quiesce()`
  promises that.
